      "Hi! Iâ€™m Faiza Faizan the founder of aba.virtual &amp; a dedicated QASP who thrived as a coach and a remote ABA trainer. My journey in the filed of ABA started in 2018 back when I was RBT. I enjoyed being a home therapist, remedial therapist and also a clinician in the past. On the onset of COVID-19 I was trained to coach parents and other caregivers on the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). Super reinforced by the outcomes my work became my passion. To this date I aspire to stretch my competencies to higher levels- in order to overcome challenges, for faster growth and extended learning for both caregivers and processionals. Aba.virtual is designed for caregivers, learners and therapists to promote independence on learning, having access to remote therapy and learning through engagement. ",
